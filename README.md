# Video Justifier

A lightweight Firefox extension designed mainly for multi-monitor setups. When a video is playing in theatre mode or fullscreen mode, this extension allows you to shift the video frame to the left or right, rather than the default centre, replacing the default black bars. This is done by overriding the site's default CSS positioning rules, foregoing the need for complex JavaScript tracking.

## Supported Platforms
- **YouTube**
- **Twitch.tv**
- **Kick.com**

## Usage

You can justify the video using either the extension popup menu or with the following keybinds:

| Action | Default Keybind |
|---|---|
| Justify Left | `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Left Arrow` |
| Justify Centre | `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Down Arrow` |
| Justify Right | `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Right Arrow` |

*(Note: Keybinds can be changed in the Firefox Add-ons manager under the gear icon > "Manage Extension Shortcuts").*
